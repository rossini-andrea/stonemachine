# The Stone Machine

## Preamble

In the late evening of 04/10/2020, I was surfing around the Internet when
suddenly a temporary perturbation in the connection allowed me to download a
costruction order coming directly from year 19106!

I could not believe my eyes, but I could not afford to lose such a rarity, and
decided to save the original document in `um-spec.txt`.

The document describes the so called "Universal Machine", a futuristic
contraption read and execute operational instructions directly from carved
sandstone and carve data itself.

I read the document, a mistery unfolding in front of me, and accepted the challenge; can a 21st century man recreate a glimpse of future technology? Would
it be ethical to create such a paradox?

## Implementation

Since everyone knows that only ancient Egyptians and Mayans could carve stone,
because they could get aid from aliens, I can solely rely on modern technology
and create a software emulator for the "Universal Machine": I call it
"The Stone Machine".

The project comprehends:

* **stonemachine**: The implementation of the actual emulator.
* **carver**: A software emulation of a machine that can read assembly code
    from paper scrolls and carve them on platters.
